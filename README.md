# Exercise 4

Get familiar with OpenAI Assistants API by working through "tutorials/agents.py".
Then change "FE/app.py" so that Threads are used in order to refer to the chat history. The user
session should contain the thread.id.

Then adjust your backend by using assistants to handle the call from the frontend, receiving
a chat request with a thread.id and a message string.
